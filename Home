## Welcome to my Cosmic World! 

This basic website has been developed to host some of the calculators and applications I have built along the way during my Master of Science (Astronomy and Astrophysics) course, with Swinburne University of Technology. My studies began in 2018 and will run through until 2021. 

Throughout the course, a number of projects required development of calculators for some of the research projects, so I decided to try my hand at coding and developing them as I progressed. The following pages are the result. 

It's always a learning process for me, so if you see something that doesn't seem right - let me know, I am always happy to improve it!
